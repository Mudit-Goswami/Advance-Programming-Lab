Assignment-7 --> Genetic Algorithm

Assignment-8&9 --> Kruskal and Prim Algorithm Implementation for finding the shortest path

Random_txt_generator --> Code to generate random numbers till 10^9 or even more(Depends on your machine)

Note --> All code were written in C++ and were build using CMake, you can run the code easily by just specifying the correct arguments with the code
